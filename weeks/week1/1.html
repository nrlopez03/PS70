  <div class="markdown-heading-2">## Background</div>

  <p>
  I enrolled in this course hoping to make something useful and practical for a final project. With a goal to design and build a device I would use, I spoke with my roommates about potential areas of opportunity. We discussed minor inconveniences and various ways in which we could implement solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
  One opportunity, we realized, was within our own suite. We have a television in our common room and very often lose the TV remote. We came up with a potential solution for frequently losing the remote.
  </p>
  
  <div class="markdown-heading-2">## Proposal</div>

  <p>
  I aspire to make a tool that makes the remote easy to locate when placed. I would design a dock for the TV remote, where the remote would be placed when not in use. (The remote is also rechargeable via USB-C and could be charged in the dock.) The remote would be attached to a smaller device which would interact with the dock. When the remote, and thus the smaller device, is removed from the dock, a timer (1-3 minutes) would begin on the dock. If the timer is completed before the remote is detected as returned, the dock would sound an alarm. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Ideally, there are various radio emitters around the room, which would enable us to triangulate the location of the remote. The alarm, given the triangualted coordinates and pre-determined location names of the common room (i.e. couch, table, etc.), the alarm would provide the current location of the remote, allowing for it to be easily located and retuned.
